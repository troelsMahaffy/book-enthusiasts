        longDescription: 'Wuthering Heights is the only novel by the English author Emily Brontë, initially published in 1847 under her pen name "Ellis Bell". It concerns two families of the landed gentry living on the West Yorkshire moors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws\' foster son, Heathcliff. The novel, influenced by Romanticism and Gothic fiction, is considered a classic of English literature.Wuthering Heights was accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along with Anne Brontë\'s Agnes Grey before the success of their sister Charlotte Brontë\'s novel Jane Eyre, but they were published later. After Emily\'s death, Charlotte edited a second edition of Wuthering Heights, which was published in 1850.[2]Wuthering Heights is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in English, but contemporaneous reviews were polarised. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, including domestic abuse, and for its challenges to Victorian morality, religion, and the class system.[3][4] It has inspired an array of adaptations across several media, including English singer-songwriter Kate Bush\'s song of the same name.',

        longDescription: 'Pride and Prejudice is the second novel by English author Jane Austen, published in 1813. A novel of manners, it follows the character development of Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist of the book, who learns about the repercussions of hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between superficial goodness and actual goodness. Mr Bennet, owner of the Longbourn estate in Hertfordshire, has five daughters, but his property is entailed and can only be passed to a male heir. His wife also lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a primary motivation driving the plot. Pride and Prejudice has consistently appeared near the top of lists of "most-loved books" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature.[1][2] For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.',

        longDescription: 'Blood Meridian; or, The Evening Redness in the West is a 1985 epic historical novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, classified under the Western, or sometimes the anti-Western, genre.[1][2] McCarthy\'s fifth book, it was published by Random House. Set in the American frontier with a loose historical context, the narrative follows a fictional teenager from Tennessee referred to as "the kid", with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred American Indians and others in the United States–Mexico borderlands from 1849 to 1850 for bounty, sadistic pleasure, and eventually out of nihilistic habit. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by Judge Holden, a physically massive, highly educated, preternaturally skilled member of the gang with pale and hairless skin who takes extreme sadistic pleasure in the destruction and domination of whatever he encounters, including children and docile animals. Although the novel initially received lukewarm critical and commercial reception,[3] it has since become highly acclaimed and is widely recognized as McCarthy\'s magnum opus and one of the greatest American novels of all time.[4] Some have labelled it the Great American Novel.',

Llewelyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone awry that has left all but one dead. That man, barely alive, asks for water. Moss responds that he does not have any, then while searching for other survivors, finds a body some distance off with a satchel containing $2.4 million in cash. He takes the money and returns home, but due to guilt, he returns to the scene with a jug of water. He finds another truck is there waiting. He tries to run, which sparks a chase through a valley. This is the beginning of a hunt for Moss that stretches for most of the novel. Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to her grandmother in Texas, while he leaves his home with the money. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell investigates the crime while trying to protect Moss and his wife, with the aid of other law enforcement agents.

        description: 'A 1968 dystopian science fiction novel by American writer Philip K. Dick.',
        longDescription: 'In a futuristic 1992 (2021 in later editions), after a global war that rendered Earth\'s atmosphere highly radioactive, most animal species are now endangered or extinct. As a result, owning real animals has become a fashionable and expensive status symbol, while poor people can only afford realistic electric robotic imitations of animals. Also, due to the radiation, people are encouraged to move to off-world colonies with the incentive of free androids: robot servants so similar in appearance to humans that only an empathy test can confirm their identities. Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police Department, is assigned to "retire" (kill) six defiant and violent androids of the new Nexus-6 model which have recently escaped from Mars and traveled to Earth. Deckard hopes this mission will earn him enough money to buy a live animal to replace his lone electric sheep, which would comfort his depressed wife Iran. First, Deckard visits the Seattle headquarters of the Rosen Association, which makes the androids, to confirm the accuracy of the empathy test on the new model. For business reasons, Rosen wishes to discredit the test and nearly succeeds. However, the test confirms twice that Rachael Rosen, his host in Seattle, is a Nexus-6 android, which she ultimately admits. Deckard returns to San Francisco to begin his hunt for the group of rebel androids. Deckard meets and kills a Soviet police contact who turns out to be one of the Nexus-6 renegades in disguise. He then moves to kill his next target, an android living as an opera singer. Meeting her backstage, Deckard attempts to administer the test, but she calls the police, who arrest Deckard and detain him at a police station staffed with officers he is surprised to have never met. An official named Garland accuses Deckard himself of being an android with implanted memories. However, after a test conclusively proves that Deckard\'s work is legitimate, Garland draws a gun on Deckard and reveals that the entire station is a sham, claiming that both Deckard and Phil Resch, the station\'s resident bounty hunter, are also androids. Resch, unaware of Garland\'s revelation, shoots Garland in the head, escaping with Deckard back to the opera singer, whom Resch next retires in cold blood. Desperate to know the truth, Resch asks Deckard to administer the empathy test on him. The test indicates Resch has sociopathic tendencies but confirms he is human. Deckard then tests himself, confirming that he is also human but has a sense of empathy for certain androids.',

        longDescription: 'Crime and Punishment[a] is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866.[1] It was later published in a single volume. It is the second of Dostoevsky\'s full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the first great novel of his mature period of writing[2] and is often cited as one of the greatest works of world literature.[3][4][5][6] Crime and Punishment follows the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of "extraordinary" men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds himself wracked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles with guilt and horror and is confronted with both internal and external consequences of his deed.',

        longDescription: 'Beginning in 2008, the novel tells the story of two mixed-race, black and white, girls who meet in 1982 in a tap class in London. The unnamed narrator, who has a white, working-class father, and a mother of Jamaican descent is immediately drawn to the precocious Tracey, who has a white mother and a black father in prison, as they have the same skin colour and are the only black children at their dance lessons. Despite the fact that the narrator\'s semi-intellectual mother looks down on Tracey, the two become best friends as they live in neighbouring estate flats. While the narrator\'s dance career is hampered by her flat feet, Tracey is something of a prodigy and goes on to win many awards. Tracey credits this in part to the fact that her father is one of Michael Jackson\'s backup dancers, a lie she makes up to explain his prolonged absences. When the girls are ten, a twenty-two year old Australian pop-star named Aimee becomes a world-wide sensation. At the birthday party of one of their friends the girls perform a sexualized dance, inspired by Aimee\'s dancing which is caught on tape by one of the girls and which is cut short when the mother of the birthday girl walks in on Tracey and the narrator on top of each other. In 1998 the narrator, newly graduated from college, is working at YTV, a music channel, and has a brief encounter with Aimee who comes to the station. When Aimee\'s assistant quits a month later, she hires the narrator to come work for her. When the narrator is in her 30s, Aimee decides to build an all girls school in a rural village in an unspecified country in West Africa (implied to be Gambia). The narrator is part of Aimee\'s advance team along with Lamin, a young Senegalese man. Aimee builds the school but the narrator finds the work they do there questionable and often useless.',

        description: 'Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.',
        longDescription: 'Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials (1963–64 novel Dune World and 1965 novel Prophet of Dune) in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny\'s This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the first installment of the Dune Chronicles. It is one of the world\'s best-selling science fiction novels.[3] Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice. Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert\'s death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999. Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed a cult following. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert\'s Dune and its 2003 sequel, Frank Herbert\'s Children of Dune (the latter of which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. It grossed $434 million worldwide and went on to be nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve\'s film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; a sequel, which covers the second half of the story, was released on March 1, 2024, to critical acclaim and has grossed $711 million worldwide.',

Edmund Exley, the son of prestigious detective Preston Exley, is a "straight arrow" who informs on other officers in a police brutality scandal. He is first and foremost a politician and a ladder climber, trying to be more than his famous father\’s son.

Between the two of them is Jack Vincennes, who acts as more of a celebrity than a cop, who is a technical advisor on a police television show called Badge of Honor (similar to the real-life show Dragnet) and provides tips to a scandal magazine. The three of them must set their differences aside to unravel the conspiracy linking the novel\'s events.',

But Fanny, John\'s wife, persuades her husband not to support them financially, leaving them to survive on a greatly reduced income. Fanny\’s brother Edward Ferrars comes on a visit, but when Elinor and he seem to be growing close, Fanny warns Mrs Dashwood that Edward is destined for higher things by their mother. Affronted by this, Mrs Dashwood decides to move her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, which has been offered her at a low rent by her second cousin, Sir John Middleton. Later, while dining with the Middletons at Barton Park, Marianne attracts the attention of a family friend, Colonel Brandon. However, he is aged thirty-five, which seems much too old to the romantic sensibility of sixteen-year-old Marianne. Marianne sprains her ankle out walking, but is carried home by John Willoughby, who sees her fall. During subsequent visits their similar artistic tastes cause the girl to fall in love with him, abandoning caution and propriety. Just as an engagement seems imminent, however, Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his elderly cousin Mrs. Smith, upon whom he is financially dependent due to his debts, is sending him to London indefinitely on business, leaving Marianne distraught. When Edward Ferrars pays a visit to Barton Cottage, he seems subdued. Shortly afterwards, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Sir John’s mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, come to stay at Barton Park. While there, Lucy forces on Elinor the secret of her prior engagement to Edward, giving Elinor an insight into Lucy\'s jealous and calculating nature. Mrs Jennings invites the elder Dashwood sisters on a visit to London. After Marianne’s letters to Willoughby go unanswered, they meet later at a dance. Willoughby is with another woman and greets Marianne coldly, later informing her of his engagement to the rich Miss Grey. Marianne is very upset but admits to Elinor that she and Willoughby never were actually engaged.',
